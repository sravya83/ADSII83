problem-1:

Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, ordered array?

A) max heap is the most effetive way to insert the elements in a priority queue implementation.In orderd array to insert an  element we have traverse the array every time to insert similar in the case for un ordered array.
