Leaning by doing-1
Two graphs are isomorphic if there is a way to rename the vertices of one to make it identical to the other. Draw all the non isomorphic graphs with two, three, four, and five vertices.
  for 2 vertices:
 taken graph     : A__B

 isomorphic graph: B__A

  for 3 vertices:
  taken graph      : A__B__C

  isomorphic graph : C__B__A
                   : B__A__C
                   : A__C__B

  For 4  vertices:
   taken graph     : 
                     A__B
                     |  |
                     C__D
isomophic graphs:
                     B__A
                     |  |
                     C__D

                     C__B
                     |  |
                     A__D

                     D__B
                     |  |
                     C__A
 For 5 vertices:

taken graph: A__B__E
	     |  |
	     C__D

isomophic graphs:
             B__A__E
	     |  |
	     C__D
 
	     E__B__A
	     |  |

	     C__B__E

	     A__D
